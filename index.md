## About Me
Hi, my name is Tamzid Morshed Rubab. My research interests lie in theoretical computer science, particularly logic and verification. I am a first year doctoral student at MPI-SWS in the Rigorous Software Engineering group under the supervision of <a href = "https://people.mpi-sws.org/~rupak/">Dr. Rupak Majumdar</a>. I am currently working with him and <a href = "https://hycodev.com/ssoudjani">Dr. Sadegh Soudjani</a> on the data driven verification of reachability in stochastic systems.

I got my BSc in Data Science and Technology at the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (2019-23). During that time, I explored various topics in theoretical computer science under the supervision of world-renowned researchers such as [**Prof. Amir Goharshady**](https://amir.goharshady.com), [**Prof. Mordecai Golin**](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=YooPxQwAAAAJ&hl=en), and [**Prof. Lionel Parreaux**](https://lptk.github.io/about.html). Please checkout my [Research](research.md) projects for further details.
