# My Research

## Parameterized Algorithms

### Prime Implicants Computation
In my **final year thesis** (Summer 2022â€“Spring 2023), I explored **parameterized algorithms** for computing **prime implicants** of Boolean expressions. I worked on algorithms that aim to optimize the process of simplifying Boolean functions, which have applications in areas like bioinformatics, databases, and fault tree analysis.

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - designed 3 novel paramterized algorithms for enumerating prime implicants of C.N.F. boolean expressions
  - proved 3 novel hardness results for various parameterizations of the same problem

## Type Theory

### Bidirectional Typing for MLScript
I designed and presented a set of **bidirectional typing rules** for the **MLScript** programming language. This work emerged from my project under **Prof. Lionel Parreaux** (Fall 2022).

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - designed bidirectional typing rules for MLScript

## Hierarchical Clustering & Approximation Algorithms

As part of my work with **Prof. Mordecai Golin** (Fall 2021), I investigated **hierarchical clustering algorithms** for graphs based on the **planted partition model**. The algorithms focused on approximating optimal clusterings under specific assumptions.

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - analyzed an approximation algorithm under strong assumption: it achieved a **near-1 approximation factor** 
  - investigated **average linkage clustering** in weaker assumption settings: it achieved a **0.5 approximation factor**
