# My Research

## Parameterized Algorithms

### Prime Implicants Computation
In my **final year thesis**, I explored **parameterized algorithms** for computing **prime implicants** of Boolean expressions. I worked on algorithms that aim to optimise the process of simplifying Boolean functions, which have applications in areas like logic synthesis and circuit design.

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - Designed 3 novel paramterized algorithms for enumerating prime implicants of C.N.F. boolean expressions
  - Proved 3 novel hardness results for certain parameterization of the same problem

## Type Theory

### Bidirectional Typing for MLScript
I designed and presented a set of **bidirectional typing rules** for the **MLScript** programming language. This work emerged from my project under **Prof. Lionel Parreaux**, which focused on enhancing the expressiveness and correctness of type systems for functional languages.

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - Designed bidirectional typing rules for MLScript

## Hierarchical Clustering & Approximation Algorithms

As part of my work with **Prof. Mordecai Golin**, I investigated **hierarchical clustering algorithms** for graphs based on the **planted partition model**. The algorithms focused on approximating optimal clusterings under specific assumptions.

- **Key Contributions**:  
  - developed a novel approximation algorithm with a **near-1 approximation factor** under strong assumption
  - investigated **average linkage clustering**, improving its performance in weaker assumption settings
